Pulp-Fiction
============

local community project for sharing books (you know, those with the pages made of paper).

the idea behind this project is to allow a user to create a virtual bookshelf where he can register books he would like to share. then, another user can browse the entire library and contact an owner if he finds a book he would like to borrow.

the current project is written over Google Apps Script, but since the database had to be moved over to Parse.com (when google decided to depricate the ScriptDb service it was built on) there is no real reason to keep it there.

I opened this repository in an attempt to move the project outside of GAS, either to Parse' Cloud Code enviroment or another, and maybe take the opportunity to implenet a new user interface using AngularJS.

for now, the code and the project is available only to community members on our [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/?rfd=1#folders/0B62cyZYTy2ndSF9lOU5QNjVmNlk) and our [Site](https://sites.google.com/site/kehilagimel/pulpfiction).

if like the idea, and wish to join in the dev team, maybe in order to start a local virtual library for your own community or help us broadening the project more globaly, feel free to contact me.

enjoy,

Itai
